## Introduction

The Memory Graph gives you a high-level view of your workspace knowledge as a graph. As agents run and produce outputs, Atlas Engine creates nodes (documents, memories, agents) and connects them with relationships like derivations, updates, and similarity links.

**Memory Graph view (empty state)** — When no agents have been run yet, the graph remains empty.

## **Empty state**

**No memory nodes available yet**

If you’re seeing this message, your workspace hasn’t generated any memory nodes yet. Run agents to populate the knowledge graph with documents and memories, and then revisit this page to explore connections.

## **Time / snapshot selector**

**Snapshot mode (Latest)**

Use the selector at the top to switch which snapshot of the graph you’re viewing (for example, the most recent graph state vs. earlier snapshots, if available).

## Legend

The right-side **Legend** explains what each node, connection, and color represents.

1. **Statistics**

   A quick summary of what exists in the graph:
   - **Memories** — total memory nodes created
   - **Documents** — ingested or referenced documents
   - **Agents** — agents that contributed to the graph
   - **Connections** — edges between nodes
2. **Nodes**

   Node types you’ll see in the graph:
   - **Document** — a source document in the workspace
   - **Memory (STM)** — short-term memory (temporary/short-lived)
   - **Memory (LTM)** — long-term memory (persistent knowledge)
   - **Agent** — the agent that generated or contributed information
3. **Status**

   Memory lifecycle states:
   - **New memory** — recently created
   - **Expiring soon** — nearing its expiration window (if applicable)
   - **Forgotten** — removed/expired memory
4. **Connections**

   How nodes are linked:
   - **Doc → Memory** — a document produced or supported a memory
   - **Doc similarity** — documents connected due to similarity
   - **Shared memory links** — memories that share references/links
5. **Relations**

   Directional relationships between nodes:
   - **Updates** — newer information updates an older node
   - **Extends** — adds more context to an existing node
   - **Derives** — created from another node
   - **Shared pool** — shared workspace-level memory linkage
6. **Similarity strength**

   Indicates how strong similarity-based connections are:
   - **Weak**
   - **Strong**

## **🔎 Search and jump to nodes**

![Image](/images/image-30.png)

Once your graph is populated, you can quickly find a specific node (document, memory, or agent) using the **search bar** at the top of the Memory Graph.

### **Search bar (top)**

- Start typing a keyword (example: AE) and Atlas Engine will show **matching nodes** in a dropdown list.
- Results are labeled by **type** (for example, **DOCUMENT**) so you know what you’re jumping into.

### **Results dropdown**

Each result shows:

- **Node name / identifier** (example: AE-1, AE-4, AE-5)
- **Node type** (example: DOCUMENT)

### **What happens when you select a result**

When you click a result from the list:

- The graph **focuses/centers** on that node
- You can immediately see its **connections and relationships** in context (linked memories, similar docs, shared pools, etc.)

### **Quick controls next to search**

Near the search bar you also have graph controls (commonly used for):

- **Zoom in / zoom out**
- **Fit / focus view** (useful when the graph is dense)

> Tip: Use search when the graph has thousands of nodes—it’s the fastest way to navigate without manually panning around.

## **What to do next**

To see the Memory Graph in action:

1. Run an agent that reads or generates outputs from your workspace.
2. Return to **Memory Graph** and explore newly created nodes and connections.
