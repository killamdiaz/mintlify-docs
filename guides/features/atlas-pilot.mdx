## **🚀 What you can do from Atlas Pilot**

![Image](/images/image-26.png)

### **1) Track what needs attention**

Right in the center of the page, Atlas Pilot shows a quick count of:

- **Pending tickets** — items that still need action
- **Closed tickets** — items already resolved

This gives you a fast “what’s the next priority?” snapshot before you dive in.

### **2) Jump into your work**

Atlas Pilot provides two main actions:

- **View my tickets** — opens your ticket queue so you can pick what to work on next
- **Create new agent** — starts agent creation so you can automate or assist with a workflow

## **🧭 Page layout**

### **Left sidebar: Navigation + workspace health**

The sidebar helps you move across Atlas Engine, and also shows usage signals like:

- **Agents**
- **Tasks**
- **Tokens**
- **Uptime**

This is helpful when you’re monitoring activity or testing agents in real time.

### **Bottom command bar: Talk to Atlas Core**

At the bottom, you’ll see the **Ask Atlas Core…** input with quick controls (like **Tools**).

Use this for interacting with Atlas while you’re in a workflow (especially during ticket solving).

## **🎫 Ticket solving mode (when you open a ticket)**

When you open a ticket from your queue, Atlas Pilot shifts into a **focused investigation + resolution view**.

### **Ticket details (main workspace)**

The central section shows the full ticket context, typically including:

- **Priority**
- **Reporter**
- **Status**
- **Description**
- **Observed behavior**
- **Expected behavior**
- **Additional notes** (systems, versions, endpoints, relevant info)

This is the “source of truth” panel you read before taking action.

### **Ticket summary + actions (right panel)**

The right panel gives you a compact, actionable view of the same ticket:

- Ticket title + ID (with navigation like **Back**)
- Quick actions:
  - **Create subtask** — break the ticket into smaller steps
  - **Link work item** — attach related tasks/incidents
  - **Create (dropdown)** — create related objects depending on your setup

### **External source context (example: Jira)**

If the ticket came from an integration, you’ll see a note like:

- “Raised via Jira” + a link such as **View request in portal**

This helps you validate the original report or continue the workflow in the source system.

### **✅ Resolve the ticket**

Once the issue is addressed, use **Resolve ticket** to close it out and move it into the “Closed” count.

## **⭐ Best practices**

- Start with **Pending tickets** → open the highest priority → use **Create subtask** for execution steps.
- Use **Link work item** whenever the ticket depends on another incident, change, or ongoing investigation.
- If the ticket is raised via Jira (or another integration), open the source request before resolving to ensure alignment.
