## Introduction

Exhausts lets you create and manage real-time log streams that Atlas Engine can ingest and analyze. Use this to bring external logs (like Zscaler LSS) or custom JSON/NDJSON logs into your workspace for monitoring, debugging, and investigation.

_The Exhausts dashboard lists all log streams along with their status and recent activity._

### **What you can do here**

- Create a new log stream (Custom or Zscaler LSS)
- Track stream connectivity (**Active / Waiting / Disconnected**)
- View stream metadata (creator, last activity)
- Link a stream to a support ticket for better traceability

### **Streams table**

The main table shows:

- **Stream Name** — your identifier for the log stream
- **Status** — stream health (Active / Waiting / Disconnected)
- **Linked Ticket** — optional ticket associated with the stream
- **Created By** — who created it
- **Last Activity** — most recent ingestion timestamp
- **Actions** — view/manage the stream

**Empty state:** If no streams exist yet, you’ll see “No log streams yet — Create your first stream to get started.”

### Create new log stream

Click **Create New Log Stream** to open the stream setup dialog.

_Choose an exhaust type, name the stream, and optionally link it to a ticket._

1. **Exhaust Type**

   Choose one:
   - **Custom Log Stream** — Generic **JSON/NDJSON ingestion** (best for internal services and custom pipelines)
   - **Zscaler LSS** — Use **LSS URL + secret** configured in Zscaler Admin
2. **Stream Name**

   Enter a descriptive name (examples):
   - prod-api-logs
   - zscaler-firewall-lss
   - agent-runtime-events
3. **Link to Ticket (Optional)**

   Attach a ticket to connect the log stream to an incident or work item.

   _Linking a ticket helps track ownership and troubleshooting context for the stream._

### **Create Stream**

Click **Create Stream** to register the stream. The stream will appear in the table and its status will update as ingestion starts.

## **🔌 When a log stream is connected**

After you create a log stream and open it, Atlas Engine shows a **stream details** screen where you can connect your system and start pushing logs in real time.

### **Stream status (top bar)**

At the top you’ll see the stream status (example: **Waiting**).

- **Waiting** means Atlas is ready, but no logs are being received yet.
- Once logs start arriving, this view becomes the live feed for the stream.

### **Stream URL**

This is the ingestion endpoint for the stream.

- Click **Copy** to copy the URL and share it with whoever is setting up the source.

### **One-time token**

A short-lived token used to authorize ingestion.

- Click **Copy** to copy the token.
- Treat this like a credential (don’t paste it in public places).

### **CLI command (recommended setup)**

Atlas provides a ready-to-run **CLI command** (example shown as a curl command) so you can start streaming logs immediately.

- Click **Copy Command** to copy the full command at once.
- The command includes:
  - The **Stream URL**
  - The **Authorization** header using the one-time token
  - A payload example (e.g., log file / NDJSON body depending on your setup)

### **Stream controls (top right)**

- **Disconnect** — stops the stream from receiving new logs (useful for pausing ingestion).
- **Chat** — opens a chat context tied to this stream (helpful for investigating what’s coming in).
- **Delete** — permanently removes the stream (use when you no longer need it).

> Tip: If the stream is stuck on **Waiting**, double-check that you’re using the correct Stream URL, the token hasn’t expired, and your source is actually sending events.
