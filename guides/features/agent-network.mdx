## Overview

The Agent Network is Atlas Engine’s visual workspace for building agent-based automations. You can create agents, wire them together, and iterate on workflows in a single canvas—then save and reuse them as “Automations”.

### **What you’re seeing on this page**

- **Canvas (grid workspace):** The main area where your agents and connections live.
- **Automation header:** Shows the current automation name and save status (e.g., _Saved_).
- **New Agent button (top-right):** Create a new agent and add it to your automation.
- **Zoom controls (left):** Zoom in/out and adjust your canvas view while building.

Use the Automation panel to manage the overall workflow container.

- **Load existing:** Switch between saved automations or start a new one.
- **Name:** Rename your automation to something meaningful (e.g., “Daily Support Triage”).
- **Description:** Add high-level context so teammates understand the purpose quickly.
- **Blueprint snapshot:** Quick stats like agents mapped and saved/live connections.
- **Actions:**
  - **Save** to persist the automation
  - **New** to start fresh
  - **Delete** to remove an automation you no longer need

## Create a new agent

Agents are the building blocks of your workflow. You can generate an agent from plain English or configure one manually with more control.

You’ll see two creation modes:

- **Natural language:** Describe what you want, and Atlas generates an agent for you.

  **Describe your agent** in one or two sentences—what it should do, what it should watch for, and what output you expect.

  Example prompts:
  - “Monitor new GitHub issues and summarize them daily.”
  - “Triages support tickets and assigns priority based on keywords.”

  Optional:
  - **Launch sandbox after creation:** Start an interactive environment right after generating the agent.
- **Manual setup:** Configure agent details and behavior explicitly.

  Use Manual setup when you want tighter control over agent behavior and inputs.

  Fill in:
  - **Agent name:** A clear label (e.g., “Ticket Triage Agent”).
  - **Role & instructions:** What the agent is responsible for and how it should behave.
  - **Objectives:** One goal per line (keeps behavior focused and testable).
  - **Tools:** Comma-separated list of tools the agent can use (e.g., Slack, Notion).
  - **Memory context:** Optional background/state the agent should always remember.

  Optional:
  - **Autonomous internet access:** Enable only when the agent needs browsing/summarization via the secure proxy.

## Tips / Best practices

- **Start simple:** Create one agent first, then expand into a multi-agent automation.
- **Name everything:** Clear automation + agent names make debugging much easier later.
- **Write objectives like checklists:** Short, specific goals produce more reliable behavior
