title: "BIlling & Usage"
description: "The Billing & Usage page gives you a clear view of token usage, cost, and where spend is coming from across your Atlas workspace. Use it to monitor consumption, spot spikes early, and understand which agents/connectors/providers are driving usage."

### **Time window filters**

In the top-right, choose a timeframe to view usage trends:

- **24h** — recent activity (great for debugging spikes)
- **7d** — week-over-week visibility
- **30d** — month-level trend (most common)
- **All** — long-term history (if available)

Changing the window updates all charts and breakdowns on the page.

## **Subscription**

### **Subscription card**

The **Subscription** section is where you manage your plan and billing settings.

- **View Plans** — compare plans and limits
- **Upgrade** — move to a higher tier when you need more capacity

This area is focused on plan management; usage insights are shown below.

## **Usage summary cards**

These top cards give a fast “health check” of your usage:

### **Today’s Tokens**

Shows tokens consumed **within the selected rolling window** (depending on the filter/timeframe).

Use it to quickly confirm whether the system is actively consuming tokens right now.

### **This Month**

Shows total tokens used **within the selected timeframe window** (ex: last 30 days).

Helpful for checking if you’re trending toward your expected monthly budget.

### **Total Cost**

Shows estimated cost for the same window, based on your pricing configuration.

Use it to understand spend at a glance before drilling into breakdowns.

> Note: Values shown are examples—your workspace will reflect your real usage.

## **Daily Tokens**

The **Daily Tokens** chart breaks down token consumption **per day** in the selected timeframe.

- Helps you identify usage spikes (e.g., a large agent run or ingestion job)
- Useful for correlating usage with deployments, incidents, or scheduled automations

Tip: If one day is unusually high, check **Top Agents** and **Connector Breakdown** next.

## **Provider Breakdown**

Shows usage grouped by **model/provider** (for example: OpenAI, Anthropic, etc., depending on what your workspace uses).

- Helps validate which provider is being used most
- Useful for cost governance and provider strategy decisions

## **Connector Breakdown**

Shows token usage grouped by **source/connector workflow**, such as:

- Crawlers / website ingestion
- Document ingestion
- Custom connectors (if enabled)

This is the fastest way to answer: **“Where is usage coming from?”**

## **Top Agents**

Lists the agents consuming the most tokens in the selected timeframe.

- Great for identifying heavy agents that need optimization
- Useful for auditing “always-on” agents or agents running too frequently

### **How to use this page effectively**

- **Spending higher than expected?** Start with **Total Cost → Daily Tokens → Top Agents**
- **Unexpected spike today?** Check **Today’s Tokens** then drill into **Connector Breakdown**
- **Budget planning?** Use **30d** or **All** and watch trends in **Daily Tokens**
