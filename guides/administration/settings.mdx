description: "Manage your profile, workspace branding, and license settings. The Settings page is where you configure your Atlas Engine workspace identity, appearance, and licensing. It’s split into three tabs: •	General → profile + security preferences •	Branding → company name + logos + login UI styling •	License → apply/verify your enterprise license and view usage limits"
---

## General

### **Profile**

Use this section to maintain your basic profile details used across the product (display name, account identity).

- Update the fields (First name / Last name)
- Click **Save profile** to apply changes
- Click **Reset** to discard edits before saving

### **Account & Security**

Manage login and notification preferences for your workspace account.

**Email**

- Shows the email tied to the currently signed-in user.

**Password**

- Use **Send reset** to trigger a password reset flow.

**Notifications**

- **Real-time alerts**: toggle instant notifications for important events.
- **Daily summary**: toggle a digest-style summary that can be sent periodically.

## Branding

![Image](/images/image-24.png)

Control how your organization appears across Atlas Engine — name, logos, favicon, and login screen styling.

This is the tab you’ll use when you want Atlas Engine to look and feel like _your company’s workspace_.

### **Company Identity**

These fields define the organization identity shown across the UI and in outbound communications.

- **Company Name**

  The full organization name shown on primary surfaces (headers, settings, etc.).
- **Short Name**

  A compact version used in areas like **emails, alerts, and UI chips** where space is limited.

✅ **Tip:** Keep _Short Name_ short (1–2 words). It’s what users will see most often in notifications.

### **Logo & Icon**

Upload branding assets used in navigation and browser-level identification.

**Upload Logo (SVG preferred)**

- Primary logo used in prominent UI locations.
- SVG is recommended for crisp rendering at all sizes.

**Upload Sidebar Logo**

- The logo shown in the left navigation sidebar.
- Useful if your sidebar needs a simplified mark (icon-only style).

**Upload Favicon (ICO/PNG)**

- The small icon shown in the browser tab.
- Helps users identify Atlas Engine quickly when many tabs are open.

**Preview**

- Use the preview area to confirm the asset placement and how it looks on a dark UI background.

**Show sidebar brand text**

- When enabled, Atlas Engine can display your brand text alongside the sidebar icon/logo.

➡️ When done, click **Save branding** to apply updates across the workspace.

### **Login Page Branding**

This section controls the **first impression** when users land on the sign-in screen.

**Login Page Loge**

- Upload the logo shown on the authentication page.

**Login Accent Color**

- Pick the accent color used for key UI highlights on the login screen.
- Usually matches your brand primary color (hex value supported).

**Background Style**

- Choose the login background style (ex: Solid), depending on what your workspace theme requires.

✅ **Tip:** Keep the accent color high-contrast so buttons and interactive elements remain clearly visible.

## License

Apply and manage enterprise licensing, entitlements, and usage visibility.

Use this tab when you:

- need to **apply a new license**,
- want to **confirm a license is active**, or
- want to **check seats/tokens remaining**.

### **License & Entitlements**

This panel shows the currently applied license state for the workspace.

**License key**

- Displays the active key status (often read-only once applied).
- The UI typically prevents editing an existing applied key to avoid accidental invalid licensing.

**Customer**

- The organization/customer mapped to the license.

**Expiry**

- When the license expires.
- If expiry is missing or not loaded, the workspace may be running without a valid applied license.

**Seats remaining**

- Number of seats still available under the license.

**Tokens**

- Token capacity remaining and usage information (if enabled in your deployment).

### **License actions (what each button does)**

**Apply New License**

- Use this to submit a new license key and activate it for the workspace.
- After applying, the license key is generally **locked/read-only** (expected behavior).

**Validate License**

- Confirms whether the applied license is valid (signature/expiry/entitlements).
- Use this if something looks wrong (ex: features disabled unexpectedly).

**Refresh License**

- Syncs latest license data from the backend (useful after changes or renewals).

**Reload Status**

- Refreshes the on-screen entitlement counters (seats/tokens) and status indicators.

✅ **Troubleshooting tip:**

If your license looks applied but usage numbers aren’t updating, try:

1. **Refresh License**
2. then **Reload Status**
