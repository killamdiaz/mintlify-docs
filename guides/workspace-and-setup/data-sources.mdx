## Introduction

The **Data Sources** page is where you bring external knowledge into Atlas Engine. Add a website to crawl, upload internal documents to index, and (soon) connect log/metric sources so agents can operate with real-time context.

## **Section 1: Knowledge Base Website Ingestion**

**What it does**

Use a documentation or wiki URL (e.g., a product docs site or internal KB) and Atlas Engine will crawl and ingest the content in the background.

**How to use**

- **Paste a base URL** (example: https://docs.yourcompany.com)
- Click **Ingest** to start processing
- Track progress under **Recent Ingestion Jobs**

**What happens during ingestion**

- Crawls linked pages under the base URL
- Extracts and chunks content
- Embeds and indexes pages for retrieval

## **Section 2: Upload Documents (PDF / PPT / DOCX)**

**What it does**

Upload internal files (PDFs, slide decks, docs) to be processed and indexed by the ingestion pipeline.

**How to use**

- Click **Choose File**
- Select a document from your machine
- Atlas Engine ingests it and makes it available for agent retrieval

**Best practices**

- Prefer “final” docs over drafts
- Use descriptive filenames for easier discovery

## **Section 3: Exhaust Systems (Logs, Events, Metrics)**

**What it does**

Connect operational data sources so agents can reason over production signals (app logs, security events, telemetry).

**Available connectors (coming soon)**

- **Syslog Feed** — ingest logs from routers, firewalls, and core systems
- **App Logs** — connect centralized logging platforms (e.g., ELK, Datadog, CloudWatch)
- **Trace & Telemetry** — stream tracing/span data for deeper visibility

> **Note:** These options may appear as “Coming Soon” depending on your deployment.

Once ingested, these sources become part of the context Atlas Engine can retrieve from during agent runs and automations.
