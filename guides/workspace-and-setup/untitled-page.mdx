## Introduction

The **Integrations** page is where you connect Atlas Engine to the tools your team already uses—identity providers for secure access, and external apps for workflows, data ingestion, and agent actions. Each tile shows the current connection status and a **Connect / Configure / Manage** action.

## **Section: Custom & Workflow**

1. **Custom API Connector**

   Connect any external API to your agents and workflows.
   - Click **Configure**

2. **Workflow Engine**

Once integrations are connected, agents can use them as **tools** (actions) and **context** (knowledge) depending on the integration type.
